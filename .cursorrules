# Docker MCP Server Project

## Project Goal
Build an MCP server that interfaces with Docker to:
1. Execute code in isolated containers
2. Return the results of code execution to the LLM
3. Provide tools for creating containers, executing code, and cleaning up containers

## Current Focus
- Fixed issue with executing Python commands containing spaces in the Docker container
- Improved command parsing using shlex for proper shell-like splitting
- Added support for executing complex multi-line Python scripts in Docker containers
- Added timeout handling and graceful fallbacks for Docker operations
- Created a proper isolated environment to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and accessible
